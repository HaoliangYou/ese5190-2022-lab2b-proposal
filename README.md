# ese5190-2022-lab2b-proposal

## Proposal

First, we use the  power supply of lab to light the LED as the following gif:

Then, We use chips to power circuits.
After checking the form and picture of pins, I found that pin mapping to RP2040 is: A0 ->29, A1->28, A2->27, A3->26.
I edited # 26 corresponding to the A0 pin of RP2040 to power the circuit and let the LED light flash at a fixed frequency as follows:

### Outline

In combination with Lab 1, gesture monitoring and proximity monitoring will be used to control the flickering of corresponding color bulbs and display corresponding contents in the text. 
I think it's cool because the previous experimental contents were reasonably used and it has certain application value in distance detection and early warning.

###Components

RP2040

APDS 9960

LED lights in different colors

Resistors

Breadboards

Connecting Wires


### Question

If we need to use more GPIO pins, how should we implement it?
